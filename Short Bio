My name is Jestella Mariz G. Mota of 2-ECE-E. I have been living on this Earth for a period of 240 months and 4 days. 
During that time period, I have been studying in the University of Santo Tomas for a total of 84 months.
Because of my stay in UST, I have mastered the ability of walking through floods and cramming school-related projects
which is a must for every Thomasian.
